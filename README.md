# ddate

Convert normal boring dates to cool discordian ones.
This is implemented as a category so just drop the files into your project and NSDate automatically gets the ability to convert dates to discordian format.

The name derives from the Linux/Unix command line tool named `ddate` that printed the current discordian date.

There is ana iOS project included in the source so you can see how to use it.

Use swipe left/right to change date and shake to get back to today's date.
